<h1 >Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Anatoliy</h1>
<h3 >Kotlin Backend Developer and Linux Enthusiast</h3>

I've been developing backend with Kotlin for over 5 years, and not only Kotlin, but mostly Kotlin.

I've also worked with JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, PHP.

Currently, I'm the tech lead of the JVM backend development team at "Center-Invest" bank.

I enjoy creating custom tools to simplify work and solve arising issues.

Some of them can be found on my GitHub: [https://github.com/LimeBeck](https://github.com/LimeBeck)

I gave a talk on [Kotlin Script: For Whom, Why and How](https://jpoint.ru/talks/4f1950e6c4144d0ea1ac306d0545217a/) at the JPoint - largest JVM conference in Russia.

Currently, I'm working on two pet projects:
* [RevealKt](https://github.com/LimeBeck/reveal-kt) - Kotlin DSL wrapper for Reveal JS with a CLI application
* [Build Time Config](https://github.com/LimeBeck/build-time-config) - Gradle plugin for embedding static application configuration at compile time
